 ## My learning in Week 1
   - Html is a not a programming language, it's only used to structure the webpages.
   - Html being so archaic, but still has been incorporated with latest updates.
   - Websites is a collection of multiple pages communicating with each other while each one of them serving a differnet aspect of the website.
   - Learned about Git and Github, although Github is just cloud repository of the git, it's based on the concept of virtual control system, where different developers can work on the same project at the same time by creating the different branches of the main branch and than making changes in their own branches without affecting the main project.
   - I have learned various basic commands of git and also deployed my first week task on the git.
   - Learnt how to effectively create a README.md file for the project.
